# Mapty-Udemy-course-project

Map based on the users geolocation, which allows the user to make a record of either a running or cycling exercise, entering their distance, elevation, cadence (for running), or elevation gain (for cycling). Records will be permanently saved unless deleted. Created with help from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/
